# ComputationalGeometryPackage
Tasks made for the Computational Geometry Course held at Ain Shams University [2022-2023] for the fall semster.

The package has the following topics: convex hull, polygon triangulation, segments intersection.

Until now only the convex hull algorithms are done.

Implemented by using C# programming language.

The project can be found at: https://github.com/NourKamaly/ComputationalGeometryPackage
# Convex Hull

In geometry, the convex hull or convex envelope or convex closure of a shape is the smallest convex set that contains it. The convex hull may be defined either as the intersection of all convex sets containing a given subset of a Euclidean space, or equivalently as the set of all convex combinations of points in the subset. For a bounded subset of the plane, the convex hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around the subset.
This package has the implementation of the following algorithms: 
1. Extreme Points  
2. Extreme Segments 
3. Jarvis March
4. Quick Hull
5. Graham Scan
6. Incremental
7. Divide and Conquer
